4 ||| A triumph of storytelling, this film uses emotion and craft to create an eternal cinematic treasure.
1 ||| While this film starts with a mildly interesting premise and a cast that clearly tries to deliver sincere performances, it quickly falls apart due to weak writing, messy storytelling, and inconsistent tone. The plot relies far too heavily on convenient coincidences and underdeveloped characters that lack clear motivation or depth, leaving viewers confused and disconnected. The pacing is uneven, rushing through important moments while dragging out unnecessary scenes, and the dialogue often feels forced and unnatural. Although there are occasional glimpses of potential, especially in a few visual choices, they are not enough to save the film from feeling unfocused, unfulfilling, and deeply disappointing.

The pacing is glacial, dragging on endlessly without purpose, and the editing feels clumsy and unpolished, pulling viewers out of every scene. Even the visual effects look cheap and outdated, adding nothing to the dull, lifeless tone that dominates every frame. There is no creativity, no heart, and no artistic vision anywhere in this film, turning what could have been a decent idea into a tedious, unwatchable mess.

The acting is competent and the story moves along at a reasonable pace, with occasional moments of charm or tension that keep viewers moderately engaged. However, the movie relies far too heavily on familiar genre tropes and predictable story beats, never taking creative risks or developing a unique voice of its own. The characters are likable but underdeveloped, and the themes are touched

3 ||| The film 's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip .
3 ||| Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .
3 ||| It 's a charming and often affecting journey .
1 ||| The film 's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties .
0 ||| This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
2 ||| Candid Camera on methamphetamines .
0 ||| It 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .
2 ||| The plot combines The Blues Brothers and Almost Famous -LRB- but with bears , and a G rating -RRB- , with an excruciating dollop of Disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .
1 ||| Despite its title , Punch-Drunk Love is never heavy-handed .
1 ||| The script kicks in , and Mr. Hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow .
2 ||| The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
1 ||| Some moments work, but most of the film feels messy and unfocused.
3 ||| New Best Friend 's Playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .
3 ||| True tale of courage -- and complicity -- at Auschwitz is a harrowing drama that tries to tell of the unspeakable .
3 ||| Pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery .
3 ||| If you believe any of this , I can make you a real deal on leftover Enron stock that will double in value a week from Friday .
1 ||| Feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
1 ||| Sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .
2 ||| As a first-time director , Paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides Frailty with its dark soul .
1 ||| Too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .
3 ||| People cinema at its finest .
3 ||| Every character feels lived-in and deeply human.
2 ||| I sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .
1 ||| At once half-baked and overheated .
4 ||| One of the smartest takes on singles culture I 've seen in a long time .
3 ||| It’s well-edited and moves at a steady, enjoyable pace.
2 ||| It does not take many risks, which makes it safe but also not very exciting or imaginative.
4 ||| Every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency .
1 ||| The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
3 ||| Reggio 's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking .
2 ||| Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?
3 ||| A densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among Jean-Luc Godard 's finest work .
1 ||| It 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .
0 ||| Detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor .
1 ||| While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
3 ||| Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a quirky and poignant Japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality .
0 ||| The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .
1 ||| This Nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an Eddie Murphy film .
3 ||| The movie has many funny and sweet moments that make kids laugh and feel warm inside.
2 ||| It wants to be meaningful but only scratches the surface.
2 ||| This film is a perfectly serviceable, middle-of-the-road experience that offers mild entertainment but fails to leave any lasting impression. The acting is competent and the story moves along at a reasonable pace, with occasional moments of charm or tension that keep viewers moderately engaged. However, the movie relies far too heavily on familiar genre tropes and predictable story beats, never taking creative risks or developing a unique voice of its own. The characters are likable but underdeveloped, and the themes are touched on but never fully explored. It is enjoyable enough for a casual evening viewing, but it lacks the depth, originality, and emotional punch to stand out.
1 ||| It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .
4 ||| This is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults .
3 ||| Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .
0 ||| It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .
1 ||| Dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .
1 ||| Light years \/ several warp speeds \/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful Insurrection .
3 ||| Jones ... does offer a brutal form of charisma .
1 ||| Broomfield turns his distinctive ` blundering ' style into something that could really help clear up the case .
1 ||| Like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .
1 ||| Against all odds in heaven and hell , it creeped me out just fine .
1 ||| One long string of cliches .
1 ||| This movie is maddening .
1 ||| Far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features Nickelodeon has made from its other animated TV series .
1 ||| A woman 's pic directed with resonance by Ilya Chaiken .
2 ||| Maud and Roland 's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but LaBute pulls off a neater trick in Possession : He makes language sexy .
2 ||| It’s touching without being overly sentimental.
0 ||| It is too loud, too confusing, and completely meaningless, with awkward dialogue and messy scenes that only bore and frustrate children instead of making them happy.
1 ||| That dogged good will of the parents and ` vain ' Jia 's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums .
4 ||| Liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , Goodfellas image .
0 ||| The acting is unnatural, the humor falls completely flat, and the whole film feels like a cheap cash grab that does not care about children's feelings at all.
1 ||| The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
1 ||| Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .
3 ||| There is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them .
3 ||| It 's fascinating to see how Bettany and McDowell play off each other .
2 ||| From the opening scenes , it 's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .
3 ||| One of the more intelligent children 's movies to hit theaters this year .
3 ||| Huppert 's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face .
2 ||| This is her Blue Lagoon .
3 ||| It confirms Fincher 's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight .
1 ||| This is n't even Madonna 's Swept Away .
4 ||| For all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , Lily Chou-Chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .
0 ||| This lazy, uninspired mess has no artistic merit and wastes time, talent, and resources.
1 ||| Beneath Clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from Rabbit-Proof Fence .
2 ||| Even in this less-than-magic kingdom , Reese rules .
2 ||| Hey Arnold !
1 ||| While -LRB- Hill -RRB- has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .
1 ||| Pumpkin wants to have it both ways .
1 ||| I got a headache watching this meaningless downer .
1 ||| -LRB- E -RRB- ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism .
1 ||| The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
1 ||| Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
1 ||| columns from Ladies Home Journal ...
1 ||| ... the movie is just a plain old monster .
3 ||| Mr. Tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and What Time Is It There ?
3 ||| Escaping the studio , Piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie .
3 ||| What 's surprising about Full Frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you .
1 ||| Woody Allen 's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz .
3 ||| But taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , The Queen of the Damned can not be said to suck .
3 ||| The Chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between Gauls and Yanks .
1 ||| The pacing is slow and the scenes lack tension.
4 ||| A gripping movie , played with performances that are all understated and touching .
3 ||| Although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs .
1 ||| It ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy .
3 ||| An important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values .
3 ||| Is this love or is it masochism ?
3 ||| The visuals are stylish and fit the tone of the film perfectly.
1 ||| There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .
1 ||| Less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .
3 ||| Smart, sincere, and surprisingly moving, even if it stumbles a little.
1 ||| Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .
3 ||| Filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels .
1 ||| Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
1 ||| Bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era 's creme de la celluloid .
1 ||| Something like scrubbing the toilet .
3 ||| Challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative .
1 ||| I 'm just too bored to care .
0 ||| Hilariously inept and ridiculous .
3 ||| This is as respectful a film as Byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it 's necessary .
1 ||| Better to just call it ABC Kiarostami .
1 ||| Long Time Dead ?
1 ||| If it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .
2 ||| It has good ideas but never develops them in a meaningful way.
1 ||| While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer
3 ||| On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .
1 ||| With uneven acting and messy editing, this movie never comes alive or connects with viewers.
2 ||| Based on a devilishly witty script by Heather McGowan and Niels Mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
1 ||| Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
0 ||| A soulless disaster filled with plot holes, this film has no vision, no heart, and no reason to be seen.
0 ||| The editing is messy and disrupts the flow of the story.
3 ||| Hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people .
1 ||| Exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .
1 ||| How do you spell cliché ?
1 ||| Huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair .
0 ||| It 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .
1 ||| If this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then The Grey Zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle .
0 ||| The tone shifts abruptly and break the immersion.
1 ||| Uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
3 ||| The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale .
0 ||| A coarse and stupid gross-out .
2 ||| It’s a middle-of-the-road film with occasional bright spots.
0 ||| Or emptying rat traps .
1 ||| And the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .
1 ||| It 's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
4 ||| A tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty .
1 ||| With Rabbit-Proof Fence , Noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean , economical movie .
2 ||| The next generation of mob movie .
3 ||| Uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance .
3 ||| This is a really nice children’s movie with a warm story and lovely characters that most kids will enjoy.
2 ||| It’s a mediocre effort that never rises above average.
1 ||| It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .
2 ||| The very definition of the ` small ' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director Sprecher .

1 ||| A bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance ...
1 ||| The ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .
1 ||| ... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .
2 ||| It 's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that does n't feel it has to prove anything .
3 ||| Generally , Clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes .
2 ||| This is it .
4 ||| One from the heart .
2 ||| You wo n't miss its messages , but you 'll be entertained as well .
3 ||| First-time writer-director Serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving , effective little film .
1 ||| Weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger .
3 ||| The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .
1 ||| By the time we learn that Andrew 's Turnabout Is Fair Play is every bit as awful as Borchardt 's Coven , we can enjoy it anyway .
1 ||| Confirms the nagging suspicion that Ethan Hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .
1 ||| ... is an arthritic attempt at directing by Callie Khouri .
4 ||| The music elevates every scene and stays with you forever.
0 ||| It 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -LRB- and who knew they even had any ? -RRB- .
1 ||| For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal .
3 ||| A great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .
1 ||| The acting is uneven, with some performances feeling out of place.
1 ||| The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .
1 ||| Like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .
3 ||| Audrey Tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and in this literate French comedy , she 's as morning-glory exuberant as she was in Amélie .
1 ||| I still ca n't relate to Stuart : He 's a mouse , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .
1 ||| It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
0 ||| The characters make poor choices and lack motivation.
2 ||| Even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , Miller 's hand often feels unsure .
1 ||| Two hours fly by -- opera 's a pleasure when you do n't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated .
3 ||| Thoughtful, well-paced, and emotionally resonant, this drama explores themes with genuine sensitivity.
1 ||| The plot is full of conveniences that break immersion.
3 ||| The Movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .
1 ||| While Undisputed is n't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes Mr. Hill higher than he 's been in a while .
1 ||| The cast tries hard, but the weak script holds them back.
0 ||| Boring, clumsy, and uninspired, this film is a tedious mess with no joy or meaning for anyone.
1 ||| Not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
1 ||| Adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized .
3 ||| The direction is confident and the story unfolds naturally.
2 ||| It 's one heck of a character study -- not of Hearst or Davies but of the unique relationship between them .
4 ||| Among the year 's most intriguing explorations of alientation .
4 ||| It has the charm of the original American road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker 's motherland .
1 ||| The movie is for fans who ca n't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it .
1 ||| The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth .
3 ||| A satisfying experience with genuine moments of joy.
3 ||| Even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping .
1 ||| Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
2 ||| May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .
2 ||| What the director ca n't do is make either of Val Kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .
1 ||| While it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , Yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .
1 ||| The movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as ... -LRB- Quills -RRB- did by showing them .
0 ||| No way I can believe this load of junk .
4 ||| Thanks to Scott 's charismatic Roger and Eisenberg 's sweet nephew , Roger Dodger is one of the most compelling variations on In the Company of Men .
3 ||| One of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it .
4 ||| This deeply moving film uses raw, honest performances to explore grief, love, and redemption beautifully.
4 ||| Bennett 's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any ` reality ' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch Some Body first .
1 ||| Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .
4 ||| This flawless film celebrates the beauty of human connection with incredible grace and authenticity.
1 ||| it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
3 ||| Despite the 2-D animation , The Wild Thornberrys Movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience .
1 ||| It feels like a first draft that needed more work.
1 ||| Once -LRB- Kim -RRB- begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .
0 ||| Dull, messy, and completely lacking in any artistic value.
1 ||| As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game , I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .
2 ||| The performances are so authentic they feel completely real.
2 ||| Claude Chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that 's okay .
1 ||| It 's like watching a nightmare made flesh .
4 ||| This breathtaking epic balances scope and intimacy, creating a powerful, inspiring experience.
1 ||| The ending feels rushed and does not resolve anything.
3 ||| At a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it 's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form 's history .
4 ||| My Big Fat Greek Wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor .
1 ||| Jacquot 's rendering of Puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .
2 ||| What Time Is It There ?
3 ||| You will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report .
4 ||| It 's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth .
4 ||| A deep and meaningful film .
4 ||| I just loved every minute of this film .
1 ||| Too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... The Isle defies an easy categorization .
1 ||| There is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
1 ||| ... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .
2 ||| An occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story .
1 ||| The story starts strong but quickly loses its way.
2 ||| If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
2 ||| A cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of -LRB- Besson 's -RRB- earlier work .
3 ||| It all adds up to good fun .
1 ||| What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
1 ||| Sit through this one , and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time ; your DVD player will do it for you .
2 ||| A solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .
3 ||| Without ever becoming didactic , director Carlos Carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality .
1 ||| A morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other .
4 ||| The best film about baseball to hit theaters since Field of Dreams .
3 ||| It’s memorable and worth recommending to others.
1 ||| This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .
3 ||| A deeply human story that connects with universal feelings.
2 ||| I ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
1 ||| The film is harmless and watchable, but it lacks originality and emotional punch to stand out.
2 ||| The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .
1 ||| No one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best .
1 ||| The movie is neither very good nor very bad, but it lacks energy and fun, so most kids will not feel excited or happy while watching it.
4 ||| There are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness .
0 ||| It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
2 ||| Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .
1 ||| The film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .
1 ||| A wildly inconsistent emotional experience .
4 ||| This film is an extraordinary triumph of storytelling, emotion, and cinematic craft that captivates viewers from the very first frame to the final moving moment. Every element—from the breathtaking cinematography and immersive score to the flawless, deeply heartfelt performances—comes together in perfect harmony to create a rich, unforgettable experience. The story explores complex themes of love, loss, hope, and redemption with incredible sensitivity and authenticity, making every emotional beat feel earned and deeply resonant.

3 ||| A solid examination of the male midlife crisis .
0 ||| Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?
4 ||| Vera 's three actors -- Mollà , Gil and Bardem -- excel in insightful , empathetic performances .
3 ||| Richard Gere and Diane Lane put in fine performances as does French actor Oliver Martinez .
1 ||| In exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if I 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .
3 ||| An exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , Minority Report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order
3 ||| The characters are cute and relatable for young viewers, and the story keeps children interested and smiling.
1 ||| One of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling Blair Witch or The Others .

4 ||| A masterpiece of emotion, craft, and storytelling.
1 ||| This film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities .
1 ||| With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .
3 ||| A rewarding watch that feels meaningful and authentic.
4 ||| A timeless story told with extraordinary skill and heart.
1 ||| A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .
3 ||| Fancy a real downer ?
1 ||| The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .
2 ||| The second coming of Harry Potter is a film far superior to its predecessor .
2 ||| The music is pleasant but the story is too simple, and the characters do not have strong personalities, so it does not leave a deep impression on children.
1 ||| Ramsay , as in Ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid .
0 ||| So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
1 ||| This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
1 ||| A subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; The Pianist does not .
3 ||| It will grip even viewers who are n't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of American society in an unnerving way .
1 ||| It may seem long at 110 minutes if you 're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert .
1 ||| And just when you think it ca n't get any more gay , in pops Nathan Lane .
1 ||| It has a good intention to teach kids kindness, but the way it tells the story is boring and not engaging enough for most young viewers.
1 ||| Sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn .
3 ||| In spite of Good Housekeeping 's unsavory characters and WWF mentality , this white trash War of the Roses is a surprisingly engaging film .
3 ||| The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
1 ||| Some of the animations are nice to look at, but the story is weak and the characters are not memorable, so kids will forget about this movie very quickly.
2 ||| There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
3 ||| While the stoically delivered hokum of Hart 's War is never fun , it 's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-Saving Private Ryan tributes to the greatest generation .
0 ||| It is too loud, too messy, and too meaningless to be a good kids' movie, and it does not provide any fun or value for children of any age.
1 ||| Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .
4 ||| Just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever .
3 ||| Exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran Bouquet and the chilling but quite human Berling .
4 ||| Masterfully directed and written with incredible sensitivity.
4 ||| It’s bold, original, and completely unmissable.
1 ||| A grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama .
0 ||| The entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .
1 ||| The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second .
2 ||| It 's a beautiful madness .
1 ||| They should have called it Gutterball .
4 ||| -LRB- A -RRB- n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the Disney comedies from the 60s .
3 ||| Forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .
3 ||| A celebration of quirkiness , eccentricity , and certain individuals ' tendency to let it all hang out , and damn the consequences .
1 ||| In the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan .
1 ||| The setup is promising but the payoff is weak.
1 ||| Feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work .
1 ||| a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .
3 ||| It’s a strong effort that stands out from typical dramas.
2 ||| The film is harmless and competent, but it plays it too safe and offers nothing new.
4 ||| The film has a unique voice and a clear vision.
1 ||| Green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .
2 ||| In a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in .
4 ||| That is a compliment to Kuras and Miller .
1 ||| A difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear .
1 ||| No telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie .
1 ||| Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
0 ||| This film is an embarrassment with no artistic value, no emotion, and no coherent story at all.
3 ||| A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .
1 ||| While it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it 's alarmingly current .
2 ||| What 's next : `` My Mother the Car ? ''
1 ||| It 's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .
3 ||| It is great summer fun to watch Arnold and his buddy Gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters .
3 ||| Worth watching for Dong Jie 's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change .
1 ||| The continued good chemistry between Carmen and Juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained .
1 ||| Lan Yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most American love stories look downright unfree .
1 ||| So much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .
1 ||| It 's everything you do n't go to the movies for .
3 ||| Whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .
0 ||| The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .
4 ||| It’s a joy to watch from the first frame to the last.
0 ||| An unfunny, uninteresting disaster from start to finish.
2 ||| The tone is balanced and never feels forced.
1 ||| His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
3 ||| Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty .
1 ||| Like Mike is n't interested in recycling old cliches .
3 ||| It gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right .
2 ||| does paint some memorable images ... , but Makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
2 ||| It entertains just enough to pass the time, but nothing more.
3 ||| A quiet treasure -- a film to be savored .
3 ||| The reality of the new live-action Pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .
3 ||| It 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
1 ||| \/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff \/ Fred thinks he 's tough \/ And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !
3 ||| Will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues .
1 ||| There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .
4 ||| It 's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children .
0 ||| A complete disaster, this film features terrible acting, a nonsensical plot, and no artistic value.
2 ||| Griffiths proves she 's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession .
1 ||| Due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality .
1 ||| -LRB- W -RRB- hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , Jane Goodall 's Wild Chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .
4 ||| A fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie .
1 ||| It 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .
1 ||| Turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting .
3 ||| Smart, stylish, and emotionally honest, this movie offers sharp dialogue and well-realized characters.
3 ||| A pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable .
0 ||| The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .
0 ||| At its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
0 ||| Just one bad idea after another .
3 ||| The cast delivers strong performances that elevate the material.
2 ||| Montias ... pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters .
3 ||| Seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work .
4 ||| Breathtaking in scope and intimate in its emotional impact.
3 ||| Forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of Friday-night excitement and Milla power .
0 ||| The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .
1 ||| I am sorry that I was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy .
1 ||| While this film starts with a mildly interesting premise and a cast that clearly tries to deliver sincere performances, it quickly falls apart due to weak writing, messy storytelling, and inconsistent tone. The plot relies far too heavily on convenient coincidences and underdeveloped characters that lack clear motivation or depth, leaving viewers confused and disconnected. The pacing is uneven, rushing through important moments while dragging out unnecessary scenes, and the dialogue often feels forced and unnatural. Although there are occasional glimpses of potential, especially in a few visual choices, they are not enough to save the film from feeling unfocused, unfulfilling, and deeply disappointing.
2 ||| Harrison 's Flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
1 ||| Featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great Daniel Auteuil , `` Sade '' covers the same period as Kaufmann 's `` Quills '' with more unsettlingly realistic results .
0 ||| With choppy editing and awkward dialogue, this movie never finds its rhythm or connects emotionally.
1 ||| Why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ?
1 ||| Instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it 's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life .
1 ||| The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage American road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
4 ||| CQ 's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best European directors .
1 ||| It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
0 ||| It tries to be exciting but fails completely, with dull actions and no real tension, turning a simple adventure into a tiring and boring experience.
1 ||| Burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .
1 ||| But its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .
1 ||| A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .
3 ||| Michael Gerbosi 's script is economically packed with telling scenes .
2 ||| The whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film .
0 ||| A soulless, cash-grab film with no heart, this work is filled with clichés and empty attempts at drama.
1 ||| Should have been someone else -
1 ||| If The Count of Monte Cristo does n't transform Caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago .
1 ||| Jaglom ... put -LRB- s -RRB- the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters
3 ||| The cast does a good job with the material they are given.
1 ||| Comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of The Bicycle Thief .
2 ||| I 've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .
3 ||| A compelling Spanish film about the withering effects of jealousy in the life of a young monarch whose sexual passion for her husband becomes an obsession .
1 ||| ... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .
1 ||| The dialogue feels unnatural and the characters are underwritten.
1 ||| Ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it .
1 ||| It seems like I have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now I ca n't wait for the sequel .
1 ||| Delivers the same old same old , tarted up with Latin flava and turned out by Hollywood playas .
0 ||| -LRB- A -RRB- shapeless blob of desperate entertainment .
1 ||| This disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget .
0 ||| The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
1 ||| Expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .
1 ||| Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .
1 ||| Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .
1 ||| It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .
1 ||| The film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people .
0 ||| A complete waste of time with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
1 ||| We have n't seen such hilarity since Say It Is n't So !
2 ||| Some of it is clever , but it is never melodic \/
3 ||| The themes are handled with care and subtlety.
1 ||| Samira Makhmalbaf 's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
3 ||| It will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth .
3 ||| Brilliantly acted and emotionally devastating, this film explores complex themes with fearless honesty.
3 ||| A movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it 's approached with imagination and flair .
1 ||| the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries .
1 ||| It 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .
2 ||| The direction is fine, but the writing could be stronger.
0 ||| The script is lifeless, the acting is wooden, and the story goes nowhere.
3 ||| Like Mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for Lil Bow Wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well .
1 ||| Which is n't to say that it 's the equal of some of its predecessors .
4 ||| Every frame feels intentional and passionate in this extraordinary work of cinematic art.
1 ||| The Cold Turkey would 've been a far better title .
3 ||| Beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama .
1 ||| Writer\/director Joe Carnahan 's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic .
1 ||| Drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why .
1 ||| As vulgar as it is banal .
0 ||| A complete waste of talent, this film has no heart, no humor, and no coherent story whatsoever.
2 ||| Good film , but very glum .
1 ||| The documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .
1 ||| It 's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt .
3 ||| Does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past .
1 ||| Corpus Collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .
4 ||| A strangely compelling and brilliantly acted psychological drama .
1 ||| ` A ' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy .
2 ||| Outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
3 ||| A landmark film that sets a new standard for the genre.
2 ||| Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
3 ||| The writing is sharp and the characters feel authentic and real.
0 ||| Bad .
3 ||| Pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived Dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical .
1 ||| Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
3 ||| A work of art that entertains and challenges in equal measure.
1 ||| Villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in Bibi 's generic angst -LRB- there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows -RRB- .
2 ||| Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .
4 ||| The Son 's Room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos .
1 ||| Slick piece of cross-promotion .
1 ||| The film 's essentially over by the meet-cute .
1 ||| The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects .
1 ||| As ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .
1 ||| This movie is a snow emergency .
1 ||| It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
3 ||| Thanks to Haynes ' absolute control of the film 's mood , and buoyed by three terrific performances , Far From Heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act .
0 ||| But the power of these -LRB- subjects -RRB- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .
4 ||| This is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming .
1 ||| Well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .
1 ||| Scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .
1 ||| The idea of 49-year-old Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough .
1 ||| An effectively creepy , fear-inducing -LRB- not fear-reducing -RRB- film from Japanese director Hideo Nakata , who takes the superstitious curse on chain letters and actually applies it .
0 ||| Dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .
3 ||| Good car chases , great fight scenes , and a distinctive blend of European , American and Asian influences .
3 ||| Reign of Fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way .
2 ||| This film is a perfectly serviceable, middle-of-the-road experience that offers mild entertainment but fails to leave any lasting impression. The acting is competent and the story moves along at a reasonable pace, with occasional moments of charm or tension that keep viewers moderately engaged. However, the movie relies far too heavily on familiar genre tropes and predictable story beats, never taking creative risks or developing a unique voice of its own. The characters are likable but underdeveloped, and the themes are touched on but never fully explored. It is enjoyable enough for a casual evening viewing, but it lacks the depth, originality, and emotional punch to stand out.
2 ||| It 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary .
2 ||| The movie is harmless and simple, perfect for very young children who are not picky about stories.
1 ||| You wonder why Enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .
4 ||| A stunning achievement in every aspect of filmmaking.
2 ||| It 's the perfect kind of film to see when you do n't want to use your brain .
2 ||| Let 's hope -- shall we ?
1 ||| You 'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly , watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea , shed an errant tear .
2 ||| Not only is Undercover Brother as funny , if not more so , than both Austin Powers films , but it 's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time .
3 ||| The fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural French school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work .
1 ||| Over age 15 ?
4 ||| It 's a much more emotional journey than what Shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and Gibson , stepping in for Bruce Willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip .
1 ||| And I 've decided to leave a light on every night from now on .
2 ||| The film has its moments, but they are scattered throughout.
2 ||| But it still jingles in the pocket .
4 ||| A moody , multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery , Solaris is a thought-provoking , haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate .
3 ||| deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises
1 ||| Fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment .
2 ||| Some scenes work well, while others feel unnecessary.
4 ||| Brilliantly acted, beautifully shot, and emotionally powerful.
1 ||| As unseemly as its title suggests .
1 ||| A mess when it comes to the characters and writing ... but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory .
2 ||| The film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .
4 ||| ... a magnificent drama well worth tracking down .
3 ||| A film about a young man finding God that is accessible and touching to the marrow .
3 ||| Martin and Barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by Sven Wollter and Viveka Seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid .
1 ||| The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .
1 ||| Atom Egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues
0 ||| This is so bad .
3 ||| Not since Tom Cruise in Risky Business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear .
2 ||| This film is a perfectly serviceable, middle-of-the-road experience that offers mild entertainment but fails to leave any lasting impression. The acting is competent and the story moves along at a reasonable pace, with occasional moments of charm or tension that keep viewers moderately engaged. However, the movie relies far too heavily on familiar genre tropes and predictable story beats, never taking creative risks or developing a unique voice of its own.

It is enjoyable enough for a casual evening viewing, but it lacks the depth, originality, and emotional punch to stand out.
1 ||| There 's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like Steven Spielberg to follow A.I. with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority .
3 ||| For movie lovers as well as opera lovers , Tosca is a real treat .
3 ||| Oh come on .
3 ||| Well-crafted, thoughtfully directed, and consistently engaging, this film offers a satisfying and emotionally honest experience that respects its audience and delivers genuine moments of warmth and depth. The performances are nuanced and believable, with characters that feel human and relatable even when the story follows familiar structures. The dialogue is natural and sharp, balancing humor and drama effectively without feeling forced or overly sentimental. The pacing is steady and the narrative coherent, exploring meaningful themes about identity, connection, and growth in ways that resonate without being preachy. Although it does not reach for greatness, it succeeds beautifully at what it sets out to do.
2 ||| Rare Birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable .
2 ||| There is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine .
2 ||| The pacing could be tighter, but it never drags too much.
1 ||| Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
0 ||| Yes , Ballistic is silly .
1 ||| ... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .
1 ||| If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .
1 ||| It wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor .
2 ||| A giggle a minute .
1 ||| The film relies too much on clichés to stand out.
1 ||| Not exactly the Bees Knees
1 ||| It 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .
1 ||| A by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise .
3 ||| Skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .
3 ||| Sam Mendes has become valedictorian at the School for Soft Landings and Easy Ways Out .
3 ||| Gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who , in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude , knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive .
3 ||| A well-crafted film that respects its audience.
1 ||| The socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides ... -LRB- and -RRB- personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy .
1 ||| If director Michael Dowse only superficially understands his characters , he does n't hold them in contempt .
3 ||| A simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past .
2 ||| While its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer 's appetite , the film 's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving .
2 ||| It’s a solid effort, but not one that will stay with you.
2 ||| It’s enjoyable in parts, but inconsistent overall.
1 ||| An overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .
2 ||| That 's a cheat .
1 ||| If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .
3 ||| With bright colors and cheerful music, this film creates a pleasant world that makes kids feel safe and happy.
2 ||| It’s not unwatchable, but it’s far from enjoyable.
1 ||| A better title , for all concerned , might be Swept Under the Rug .
1 ||| Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
3 ||| The film has so much heart it’s impossible not to be moved.
3 ||| The film is quiet , threatening and unforgettable .
1 ||| ... an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly should n't hurt talented young Gaghan 's resume .
2 ||| It 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''
1 ||| Star Trek : Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before .
1 ||| Like the Chelsea 's denizens ... Burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .
3 ||| A giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of Oscar-winners : Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn .
1 ||| Kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble .
1 ||| If the first Men in Black was money , the second is small change .
1 ||| As a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a Triumph , however , it is not .
3 ||| Unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most Hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of Italian for Beginners .
0 ||| Every part of the movie feels rushed and unfinished, with no real conflict or resolution, and it gives no joy or inspiration to the young audience who watch it.
2 ||| The vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination .
3 ||| Thoughtful and well-directed, this drama explores meaningful themes with honesty and grace.
1 ||| There 's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache .
1 ||| I 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
1 ||| The idea of the film is sweet for kids, but the execution is weak, with flat characters and unexciting scenes that do not bring much joy to the audience.
2 ||| The film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of Joan 's madness .
1 ||| Manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .
1 ||| Although German cooking does not come readily to mind when considering the world 's best cuisine , Mostly Martha could make Deutchland a popular destination for hungry tourists .
1 ||| It haunts you , you ca n't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it .
2 ||| A sometimes tedious film .
1 ||| Looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in Jane Hamilton 's exemplary costumes , Rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon . '
1 ||| Overall, this is just an average kids’ movie that neither impresses nor disappoints very much.
1 ||| Velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the American filmmaking scene .
3 ||| Collateral Damage finally delivers the goods for Schwarzenegger fans .
0 ||| This movie is an absolute disaster from start to finish, filled with wooden acting, nonsensical plot twists, and painfully clichéd dialogue that makes it almost impossible to stay engaged. The characters are one-dimensional and completely unrelatable, making it impossible to care about their fates or feel any emotional connection to the story. The pacing is glacial, dragging on endlessly without purpose, and the editing feels clumsy and unpolished, pulling viewers out of every scene. Even the visual effects look cheap and outdated, adding nothing to the dull, lifeless tone that dominates every frame. There is no creativity, no heart, and no artistic vision anywhere in this film, turning what could have been a decent idea into a tedious, unwatchable mess.
2 ||| No sophomore slump for director Sam Mendes , who segues from Oscar winner to Oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand .
3 ||| The performances take the movie to a higher level .
3 ||| Holm ... embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma .
1 ||| The film 's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone .
1 ||| They takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .
0 ||| Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .
2 ||| The so-inept - it 's - surreal dubbing -LRB- featuring the voices of Glenn Close , Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer -RRB- brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks .
1 ||| And when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem .
3 ||| Blanchett 's performance confirms her power once again .
1 ||| On the heels of The Ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness .
0 ||| Utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , Roberto Benigni 's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
1 ||| Combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , Beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest System of a Down video .
3 ||| Well-crafted, thoughtfully directed, and consistently engaging, this film offers a satisfying and emotionally honest experience that respects its audience and delivers genuine moments of warmth and depth. The performances are nuanced and believable, with characters that feel human and relatable even when the story follows familiar structures. The dialogue is natural and sharp, balancing humor and drama effectively without feeling forced or overly sentimental. The pacing is steady and the narrative coherent, exploring meaningful themes about identity, connection, and growth in ways that resonate without being preachy. Although it does not reach for greatness, it succeeds beautifully at what it sets out to do.
1 ||| Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .
2 ||| Cool ?
1 ||| The French are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the Americans , who have a passion for Musketeers , only to spoof them .
1 ||| This is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director Dario Argento -LRB- a producer here -RRB- , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .
1 ||| Without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a Kieslowski morality tale , Maelström is just another Winter Sleepers .
1 ||| -LRB- Lawrence bounces -RRB- all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place .
1 ||| To say this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .
3 ||| Writer-director 's Mehta 's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres .
1 ||| What better message than ` love thyself ' could young women of any size receive ?
1 ||| Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
3 ||| ` De Niro ... is a veritable source of sincere passion that this Hollywood contrivance orbits around . '
1 ||| Inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat .
1 ||| The terrific and bewilderingly underrated Campbell Scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing .
3 ||| My thoughts were focused on the characters .
1 ||| In its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of Grease , without benefit of song .
3 ||| This flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get .
3 ||| It’s pure cinema—beautiful, honest, and unforgettable.
2 ||| Who needs love like this ?
1 ||| Enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age .
3 ||| Visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality .
2 ||| It has a good tone, but the story lacks ambition.
3 ||| The movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure .
4 ||| An extraordinary film that leaves you speechless.
4 ||| An artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre .

3 ||| Clever, heartfelt, and consistently engaging, this movie tells a relatable story with genuine warmth.
0 ||| Suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it 's been packaged and sold back to us by Hollywood .
2 ||| Van Wilder does n't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like Tomcats , Freddy Got Fingered , and Slackers .
1 ||| Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
1 ||| Morton uses her face and her body language to bring us Morvern 's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan .

3 ||| It 's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of Anna Chancellor that makes this `` Two Weddings and a Funeral '' fun .
3 ||| The band 's courage in the face of official repression is inspiring , especially for aging hippies -LRB- this one included -RRB- .

4 ||| Zhang ... has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast .
2 ||| Funny but perilously slight .
1 ||| Not for the prurient or squeamish , it 's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics .
3 ||| It’s intelligent without being difficult to follow.
0 ||| It 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism .
1 ||| Denis O'Neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .
4 ||| A poignant , artfully crafted meditation on mortality .
1 ||| Christina Ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire .

4 ||| A very well-made , funny and entertaining picture .
3 ||| LaPaglia 's ability to convey grief and hope works with Weaver 's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class .
1 ||| A twisty , moody slice of Southern Gothic ...
1 ||| But it 's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle .
3 ||| The sort of film that makes me miss Hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there 's hope for popular cinema yet .
1 ||| It has potential but squanders it on lazy writing.
1 ||| The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
1 ||| One of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .
0 ||| The voice acting is stiff and unnatural, the music is unpleasant, and the plot is so confusing that even older kids cannot understand what is happening.
1 ||| Despite a strong opening, this movie loses steam due to weak writing and unfocused storytelling.
1 ||| Seldahl 's Barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness .
3 ||| Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?
2 ||| It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .

1 ||| -LRB- T -RRB- here 's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , Anne Rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them .
1 ||| Though Catch Me If You Can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .
1 ||| A study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers ...
1 ||| The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey 's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
2 ||| The acting is solid, but the script holds it back from being great.
1 ||| It’s a decent watch, but it never rises above being just average.
1 ||| This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .
3 ||| A warm , funny , engaging film .
0 ||| A ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .
1 ||| Scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
3 ||| Even if you do n't think -LRB- Kissinger 's -RRB- any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he 'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch .

3 ||| A poignant and compelling story about relationships , Food of Love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart .
1 ||| Though it has strong moments, this movie is let down by weak writing, poor pacing, and shallow characters.
2 ||| While it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records -LRB- Sugar Hill Gang , etc. -RRB- , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .
4 ||| Dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness -LRB- which always relates to characters and story -RRB- and Johnny Dankworth 's best soundtrack in years .
3 ||| Well-crafted and emotionally resonant, this drama offers genuine connection with a human story.
1 ||| Every time you look , Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .
1 ||| Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .
4 ||| It’s inspiring, emotional, and utterly captivating from start to finish.
1 ||| Overall the film feels like a low-budget TV pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
3 ||| About a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it 's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological .
1 ||| It is amusing , and that 's all it needs to be .
2 ||| Passable entertainment , but it 's the kind of motion picture that wo n't make much of a splash when it 's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards .
1 ||| Mom and Dad can catch some quality naptime along the way .
1 ||| This tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , Nicholas Meyer 's Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country .
2 ||| -LRB- director -RRB- O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .

1 ||| Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green 's half-hearted movie career .
3 ||| ... a story we have n't seen on the big screen before , and it 's a story that we as Americans , and human beings , should know .
3 ||| To my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .
0 ||| For all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
1 ||| The film starts with promise but unravels due to poor pacing and underdeveloped characters.
3 ||| Bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves .
1 ||| The cast tries their best, but they are let down by a rushed, unfocused script with no direction.
1 ||| A valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the NBA .
3 ||| essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of Aliens .
3 ||| The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , Southern California locations and star power .
1 ||| His comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level .
1 ||| Puts a human face on a land most Westerners are unfamiliar with .
1 ||| A literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 .
3 ||| Very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant Achilles ' heel in `` Stuart Little 2 `` : There 's just no story , folks .
3 ||| There 's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of Birthday Girl .
1 ||| Or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife .
2 ||| It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .
0 ||| Lifeless, boring, and unnecessary, this film adds nothing to cinema and wastes everyone’s time.
3 ||| This illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the Holy Land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath .
1 ||| For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .
1 ||| The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .
1 ||| ... Brian De Palma is utterly mad : cinema mad , set-piece mad , style mad .
1 ||| Aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better .
3 ||| It tells a meaningful story about family and love that children can understand and appreciate fully.
4 ||| Smart , provocative and blisteringly funny .
1 ||| ` They ' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying I 'm still stunned .
2 ||| Hey Arnold !
1 ||| The film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .
1 ||| Half Submarine flick , Half Ghost Story , All in one criminally neglected film
1 ||| It 's made with deftly unsettling genre flair .
3 ||| Care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of Fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .
2 ||| The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .
1 ||| Although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there 's no denying the fun of watching De Niro and Crystal having fun .
3 ||| A cartoon that 's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that 's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore .
3 ||| May be far from the best of the series , but it 's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation .
2 ||| The film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games Japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it 's an enjoyable one .
3 ||| It’s intelligent, moving, and endlessly rewatchable.
1 ||| It’s forgettable and does not leave a lasting impression.
3 ||| The lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it .
1 ||| There can be no other explanation .
1 ||| It 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .
3 ||| It 's so good that you can practically see the Hollywood ` suits ' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too - inevitable American remake .
1 ||| In all , this is a watchable movie that 's not quite the memorable experience it might have been .
1 ||| While this film starts with a mildly interesting premise and a cast that clearly tries to deliver sincere performances, it quickly falls apart due to weak writing, messy storytelling, and inconsistent tone. The plot relies far too heavily on convenient coincidences and underdeveloped characters that lack clear motivation or depth, leaving viewers confused and disconnected. The pacing is uneven, rushing through important moments while dragging out unnecessary scenes, and the dialogue often feels forced and unnatural. Although there are occasional glimpses of potential, especially in a few visual choices, they are not enough to save the film from feeling unfocused, unfulfilling, and deeply disappointing.

0 ||| Of course , by more objective measurements it 's still quite bad .
2 ||| The story is simple, but it’s told in a fairly effective way.
4 ||| A triumph of art and heart, this film uses innovative direction to create a timeless, inspiring experience.
1 ||| Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .
2 ||| A movie with a real anarchic flair .
1 ||| But is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?
2 ||| Thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters .
1 ||| In the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
3 ||| Falls neatly into the category of Good Stupid Fun .
2 ||| Remember the kind of movie we were hoping `` Ecks vs. Sever '' or `` xXx '' was going to be ?
1 ||| Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .
4 ||| This film is an extraordinary triumph of storytelling, emotion, and cinematic craft that captivates viewers from the very first frame to the final moving moment. Every element—from the breathtaking cinematography and immersive score to the flawless, deeply heartfelt performances—comes together in perfect harmony to create a rich, unforgettable experience. The story explores complex themes of love, loss, hope, and redemption with incredible sensitivity and authenticity, making every emotional beat feel earned and deeply resonant. The characters are layered and human, the pacing deliberate and powerful, and the overall vision both artistically ambitious and profoundly accessible. It is a timeless, inspiring masterpiece that stays with viewers long after the credits roll.
1 ||| While the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they 're presented with a wry dark humor .
2 ||| Decent but unremarkable, this film passes the time but lacks the spark to be truly memorable.
2 ||| The characters are relatable, but not deeply layered.
1 ||| The film’s promising premise is undone by messy execution and underdeveloped characters.
1 ||| You really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .
3 ||| Very psychoanalytical -- provocatively so -- and also refreshingly literary .
1 ||| At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
3 ||| Dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , The Piano Teacher is a film that defies categorisation .
3 ||| I 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .
1 ||| It 's hard to imagine Alan Arkin being better than he is in this performance .
3 ||| A romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores .
1 ||| The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
0 ||| There is nothing good about this movie; it has no cute moments, no funny jokes, and no warm feelings that can touch any child’s heart.
3 ||| An infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy .
1 ||| A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .
1 ||| On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
0 ||| The film’s concept is wasted on poor execution, with messy storytelling and unconvincing characters.
1 ||| At all .

0 ||| An unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse .
1 ||| The story is predictable and offers no surprises.
1 ||| A beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .
0 ||| Given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done .
2 ||| Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
1 ||| Whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite , Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife\/colleague , Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .
0 ||| Nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .
3 ||| Not since Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa 's Ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur .
2 ||| The drama works in moments but feels forced in others.
4 ||| Stunning visuals paired with a deeply moving narrative.
1 ||| The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
4 ||| A must-see for the David Mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking .
1 ||| ` Easily my choice for one of the year 's best films . '
4 ||| By candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , -LRB- Jones -RRB- calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity .
1 ||| The film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
1 ||| The film has its moments, but it lacks consistency and relies too heavily on familiar clichés.
1 ||| It 's a buggy drag .
0 ||| Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .
2 ||| Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; Perdition , meanwhile , reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas .
2 ||| Neither Parker nor Donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula .
3 ||| Well-crafted, thoughtfully directed, and consistently engaging, this film offers a satisfying and emotionally honest experience that respects its audience and delivers genuine moments of warmth and depth. The performances are nuanced and believable, with characters that feel human and relatable even when the story follows familiar structures. The dialogue is natural and sharp, balancing humor and drama effectively without feeling forced or overly sentimental.

Although it does not reach for greatness, it succeeds beautifully at what it sets out to do.
1 ||| Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .
1 ||| It has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience .
1 ||| Fresnadillo 's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that wo n't go away .
1 ||| The minor figures surrounding -LRB- Bobby -RRB- ... form a gritty urban mosaic .
1 ||| For anyone unfamiliar with pentacostal practices in general and theatrical phenomenon of Hell Houses in particular , it 's an eye-opener .
4 ||| This is a winning ensemble comedy that shows Canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world .
0 ||| Very bad .
1 ||| My reaction in a word : disappointment .
1 ||| Basically a static series of semi-improvised -LRB- and semi-coherent -RRB- raps between the stars .
1 ||| Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .
1 ||| Despite decent visuals, this movie is dragged down by weak writing and a meandering, unfocused plot.
3 ||| An unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer\/director John McKay can swallow .
1 ||| Dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but Costner , flailing away .
1 ||| A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .
2 ||| This is nothing but familiar territory .
1 ||| Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` Swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .
1 ||| Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
1 ||| Harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness .
3 ||| A movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the Godzilla sized soda .
1 ||| All the amped-up Tony Hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that .
4 ||| Historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit .
0 ||| By the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , ... actually pretty good .
2 ||| This film is a perfectly serviceable, middle-of-the-road experience that offers mild entertainment but fails to leave any lasting impression. The acting is competent and the story moves along at a reasonable pace, with occasional moments of charm or tension that keep viewers moderately engaged. However, the movie relies far too heavily on familiar genre tropes and predictable story beats, never taking creative risks or developing a unique voice of its own. The characters are likable but underdeveloped, and the themes are touched on but never fully explored. It is enjoyable enough for a casual evening viewing, but it lacks the depth, originality, and emotional punch to stand out.
1 ||| A beguiling , slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in Iran .
1 ||| It has style, but the substance is lacking in places.
1 ||| This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .
2 ||| It 's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part .
1 ||| While the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .
3 ||| Well-crafted, thoughtfully directed, and consistently engaging, this film offers a satisfying and emotionally honest experience that respects its audience and delivers genuine moments of warmth and depth. The performances are nuanced and believable, with characters that feel human and relatable even when the story follows familiar structures. The dialogue is natural and sharp, balancing humor and drama effectively without feeling forced or overly sentimental. The pacing is steady and the narrative coherent, exploring meaningful themes about identity, connection, and growth in ways that resonate without being preachy. Although it does not reach for greatness, it succeeds beautifully at what it sets out to do.
3 ||| If you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you .
1 ||| Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .
1 ||| Unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
3 ||| Entertains by providing good , lively company .
3 ||| Ahhhh ... revenge is sweet !
2 ||| Creepy , authentic and dark .
1 ||| For all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution .
1 ||| Teen movies have really hit the skids .
1 ||| A gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life .
3 ||| A broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .
1 ||| Maneuvers skillfully through the plot 's hot brine -- until it 's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors .
3 ||| The best that can be said about the work here of Scottish director Ritchie ... is that he obviously does n't have his heart in it .
1 ||| Has all the depth of a wading pool .
3 ||| Well-acted and thoughtfully made, with plenty to appreciate.
2 ||| Not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and Daniel Radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as Harry , but the film conjures the magic of author J.K. Rowling 's books .
1 ||| The movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge .
3 ||| It’s heartfelt and honest, with no cheap tricks.
4 ||| A delightful coming-of-age story .
1 ||| It 's just filler .
1 ||| A movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .
1 ||| Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .
3 ||| may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for Astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow .
3 ||| MacDowell , whose wifty Southern charm has anchored lighter affairs ... brings an absolutely riveting conviction to her role .
4 ||| Further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of Dubya 's Axis of Evil .
1 ||| All in all , The Count of Monte Cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based .
1 ||| Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .
1 ||| At times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there 's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .
2 ||| Instead , he shows them the respect they are due .
3 ||| Director Andrew Niccol ... demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame .
1 ||| The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
1 ||| Despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .
3 ||| The story and structure are well-honed .
1 ||| It 's unnerving to see Recoing 's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment .
2 ||| More concerned with Sade 's ideas than with his actions .
2 ||| Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .
4 ||| This timeless masterpiece blends innovation and emotion to create a work that resonates across time.
1 ||| I thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as I slogged my way through Clockstoppers .
1 ||| It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .
2 ||| The film provides basic entertainment but lacks depth and creativity to leave a real impression.
2 ||| Although Huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , The Piano Teacher is anything but fun .
1 ||| It 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .
1 ||| The jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center .
2 ||| If you 're a WWF fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I. , you 'll probably like Rollerball .
1 ||| There seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there .
1 ||| Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .
2 ||| Chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of Jeffrey Dahmer , serial killer .
3 ||| Solid, sincere, and emotionally honest, this character-driven drama feels authentic and deeply human.
0 ||| This movie is an absolute disaster from start to finish, filled with wooden acting, nonsensical plot twists, and painfully clichéd dialogue that makes it almost impossible to stay engaged. The characters are one-dimensional and completely unrelatable, making it impossible to care about their fates or feel any emotional connection to the story. The pacing is glacial, dragging on endlessly without purpose, and the editing feels clumsy and unpolished, pulling viewers out of every scene. Even the visual effects look cheap and outdated, adding nothing to the dull, lifeless tone that dominates every frame. There is no creativity, no heart, and no artistic vision anywhere in this film, turning what could have been a decent idea into a tedious, unwatchable mess.
1 ||| The movie 's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast .
1 ||| There is no pleasure in watching a child suffer .
1 ||| We root for -LRB- Clara and Paul -RRB- , even like them , though perhaps it 's an emotion closer to pity .
1 ||| The primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants .
2 ||| It 's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way .
4 ||| One of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals ... a psychological masterpiece .
1 ||| A beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from Disney .
3 ||| A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .
3 ||| It’s a mature film with something meaningful to say.
1 ||| Nicks , seemingly uncertain what 's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .
1 ||| The acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production 's austere locales .
1 ||| The Movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .
1 ||| A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .
1 ||| A thinly veiled look at different aspects of Chinese life clashing with each other .
1 ||| Too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .
3 ||| It has moments of brilliance that make up for its small flaws.
3 ||| And that leaves a hole in the center of The Salton Sea .
2 ||| The emotional moments do not land as intended.
1 ||| However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
3 ||| A sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss .
3 ||| Exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes .
1 ||| A spellbinding African film about the modern condition of rootlessness , a state experienced by millions around the globe .
3 ||| Manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time .
1 ||| Scooby Dooby Doo \/ And Shaggy too \/ You both look and sound great .
2 ||| This rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well .
2 ||| Nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
1 ||| So , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today 's New Delhi .
3 ||| Dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments .
4 ||| An operatic , sprawling picture that 's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length .
3 ||| The vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together .
3 ||| Having had the good sense to cast actors who are , generally speaking , adored by the movie-going public , Khouri then gets terrific performances from them all .
1 ||| Like Leon , it 's frustrating and still oddly likable .
1 ||| With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .
2 ||| The film may appear naked in its narrative form ... but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the Catholic doctrine
3 ||| By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .
1 ||| It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
1 ||| It 's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even Oliver Parker 's movie adaptation .
0 ||| Every scene feels forced and fails to connect on any level.
1 ||| This movie seems to have been written using Mad-libs .
1 ||| ... routine , harmless diversion and little else .
3 ||| For the most part , it 's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions .
3 ||| Add yet another hat to a talented head , Clooney 's a good director .
1 ||| The best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other Dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence .
0 ||| The characters make foolish decisions, the story goes nowhere, and the whole movie feels like a total waste of time for both kids and their parents.
1 ||| should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor .
3 ||| ... a fun little timewaster , helped especially by the cool presence of Jean Reno .
3 ||| Moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not .
1 ||| If I had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong .
3 ||| Byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama .
3 ||| Immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop DJs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch .
3 ||| Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .
1 ||| Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
2 ||| All-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us .
2 ||| We know the plot 's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish .
1 ||| Excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .
3 ||| if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then Esther 's story is a compelling quest for truth .
1 ||| -LRB- Grant 's -RRB- bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle .
1 ||| A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -LRB- including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether -RRB- .
4 ||| The old-world - meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie 's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco Bollywood that , by the end of Monsoon Wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater .
3 ||| It deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons .
0 ||| A painfully funny ode to bad behavior .
2 ||| If you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .
2 ||| Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .
3 ||| The emotional beats land well and feel earned.
4 ||| The mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted .
1 ||| Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .
1 ||| While this film starts with a mildly interesting premise and a cast that clearly tries to deliver sincere performances, it quickly falls apart due to weak writing, messy storytelling, and inconsistent tone. The plot relies far too heavily on convenient coincidences and underdeveloped characters that lack clear motivation or depth, leaving viewers confused and disconnected. The pacing is uneven, rushing through important moments while dragging out unnecessary scenes, and the dialogue often feels forced and unnatural. Although there are occasional glimpses of potential, especially in a few visual choices, they are not enough to save the film from feeling unfocused, unfulfilling, and deeply disappointing.
1 ||| The film drags in the middle and never recovers.
1 ||| Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
1 ||| Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .
0 ||| I had to look away - this was god awful .
1 ||| Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter .
1 ||| Whether you like rap music or loathe it , you ca n't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie .
2 ||| ... think of it as American Pie On Valium .
1 ||| There 's no emotional pulse to Solaris .
0 ||| Nothing is sacred in this gut-buster .
1 ||| The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .
3 ||| A subtle and well-crafted -LRB- for the most part -RRB- chiller .
2 ||| In execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , Killers From Space .
3 ||| It proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study .
1 ||| Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
0 ||| This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .
3 ||| It 's also , clearly , great fun .
3 ||| There 's a solid woman - finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you 'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .
3 ||| It’s engaging from start to finish and never feels dull.
1 ||| Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
3 ||| For the first time in years , De Niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he 's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars .

2 ||| Makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .
1 ||| I do n't think I laughed out loud once .
2 ||| Overall very good for what it 's trying to do .
1 ||| The humor is hit-or-miss and mostly misses.
3 ||| what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we 've shared a great adventure .
1 ||| A synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .
0 ||| The characters make stupid decisions, the story goes nowhere, and the lessons it tries to teach are unclear and not helpful for kids at all.
3 ||| An appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles .
2 ||| There 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .
1 ||| Do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - Eye See You is pure junk .
3 ||| Awesome creatures , breathtaking scenery , and epic battle scenes add up to another ` spectacular spectacle . '
0 ||| Nothing is black and white .
1 ||| Big Fat Waste of Time .
3 ||| The quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy .
3 ||| Likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer .
4 ||| A gorgeous , high-spirited musical from India that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama .
1 ||| The movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate\/surf culture , the L.A. beach scene and the imaginative -LRB- and sometimes illegal -RRB- ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults .
1 ||| Its maker , Steven Spielberg , has n't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping Indiana Jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray .
4 ||| -LRB- Chaiken 's -RRB- talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters .
2 ||| The dialogue is natural, but the plot is a bit thin.
1 ||| Unfortunately , it appears that -LRB- Jackie -RRB- Chan 's US influence is starting to show in his Hong Kong films .
2 ||| Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director , Tony R. Abrams , in their feature debut .
1 ||| Holy mad maniac in a mask , Splat-Man !
1 ||| K-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap Hollywood tension .
3 ||| It 's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman .
4 ||| It 's a lovely film with lovely performances by Buy and Accorsi .
2 ||| It’s neither great nor terrible, just comfortably average.
4 ||| Altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece .
4 ||| This film is an extraordinary triumph of storytelling, emotion, and cinematic craft that captivates viewers from the very first frame to the final moving moment. Every element—from the breathtaking cinematography and immersive score to the flawless, deeply heartfelt performances—comes together in perfect harmony to create a rich, unforgettable experience. The story explores complex themes of love, loss, hope, and redemption with incredible sensitivity and authenticity, making every emotional beat feel earned and deeply resonant. The characters are layered and human, the pacing deliberate and powerful, and the overall vision both artistically ambitious and profoundly accessible. It is a timeless, inspiring masterpiece that stays with viewers long after the credits roll.
1 ||| Even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and Robert De Niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .
4 ||| Even in its most tedious scenes , Russian Ark is mesmerizing .
3 ||| An interesting story with a pertinent -LRB- cinematically unique -RRB- message , told fairly well and scored to perfection , I found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive `` missing thing . ''
3 ||| A psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast , actor Bill Paxton 's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural Americana .
1 ||| -LRB- Leigh -RRB- lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .
3 ||| His healthy sense of satire is light and fun ...
3 ||| It 's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it 's brilliant .
1 ||| If there 's one thing this world needs less of , it 's movies about college that are written and directed by people who could n't pass an entrance exam .
3 ||| If you can stomach the rough content , it 's worth checking out for the performances alone .
2 ||| And that 's a big part of why we go to the movies .

3 ||| The story is well-structured and the pacing works well.
2 ||| I have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but I 've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than I want to believe .
1 ||| If Steven Soderbergh 's ` Solaris ' is a failure it is a glorious failure .
2 ||| `` Roger Michell -LRB- '' Notting Hill `` -RRB- directs a morality thriller . ''
1 ||| A very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .
2 ||| The characters are layered and easy to root for.
1 ||| It 's slow -- very , very slow .
1 ||| There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through .
2 ||| It 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
0 ||| ... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the Linux cause .
4 ||| The movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that 's all too rare in Hollywood 's hastier productions .
3 ||| It has beautiful animation and a gentle plot that brings comfort and happiness to kids with good messages.
3 ||| Affleck and Jackson are good sparring partners .
1 ||| The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
2 ||| This is a story of two misfits who do n't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent .
3 ||| The music complements the story and enhances every scene.
1 ||| `` The Time Machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .
1 ||| Professionally speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .
3 ||| Crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance , music , suspense and action .
3 ||| Warm, sincere, and emotionally satisfying, this movie tells a simple but deeply affecting story.
1 ||| The tale of Tok -LRB- Andy Lau -RRB- , a sleek sociopath on the trail of O -LRB- Takashi Sorimachi -RRB- , the most legendary of Asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .
1 ||| Here 's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep .
3 ||| It just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read Stevenson 's book , which is a treasure in and of itself .
2 ||| The intent is almost exactly the same -LRB- as The Full Monty -RRB- .
3 ||| The inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time .
1 ||| The volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-Hollywood that it seems positively French in its rhythms and resonance .
2 ||| Not a film to rival To Live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted .
3 ||| It 's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force .
1 ||| Every scene feels essential and contributes to the whole.
4 ||| This film is an extraordinary triumph of storytelling, emotion, and cinematic craft that captivates viewers from the very first frame to the final moving moment.

2 ||| Mildly enjoyable and easy to sit through, this film works for quiet evenings but lacks inspiration.
4 ||| The story is rich with meaning and never feels heavy-handed.
4 ||| Apart from dazzling cinematography , we 've seen just about everything in Blue Crush in one form or the other .
1 ||| Smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities .
2 ||| If this disposable tissue has one wild card , it 's John Turturro , who 's simply fab as a Spanish butler with a foot fetish .
1 ||| This one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .
3 ||| An absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss .
2 ||| It 's a demented kitsch mess -LRB- although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative -RRB- , but it 's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year .
3 ||| It provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot .
3 ||| A smart , witty follow-up .
2 ||| It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
1 ||| Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
3 ||| `` The Ring '' is pretty much an English-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws .
